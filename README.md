Hello!

This project is a new website with content about recipes (great because I  LOVE food!!)

Skills learned so far:
    1) Using Git as a workflow and storage system for various projects (modify > stage > commit)
    2) Using GitHub as an online, remote resource for working projects
    3) Basic HTML language to create a multi page website:
        a) Create index.html homepage with important metadata (html type, title, charset etc)
        b) Create multiple html pages with content (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, text)
        c) Create working absolute & relative links to other pages either online or in local structure
        d) Embed images within website with appropriate attributes
